# pythonProject
This project aims to show my current Python-level. I'm learning on my own and will be soon done with all the basic stuff, such as: variables, lists, if construction, dictionaries, input() function, loops (for, while) and functions. Now I'm learning classes and object oriented programming. After that I'll start making my first project.
